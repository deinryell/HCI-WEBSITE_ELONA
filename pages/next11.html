        <h1>Fender<span> Meteora</span></h1>
        <p>Fusing innovative Fender design with player-centric features and exciting new finishes, the Player Plus Meteora Bass delivers superb playability and unmistakable style.

            Powered by a pair of Fireball™ Bass Humbucking pickups, the Player Plus Meteora Bass delivers the punch and growl that defines Fender bass tone. A 3-band active EQ provides precise tone shaping with switchable active/passive operation for ultimate flexibility. The Player Plus Meteora Bass neck is sleek, fast, and smooth thanks to its silky satin finish, comfortable rolled edges on a 12” inch radius fingerboard, and modern “C” back-shape. A rock solid HiMass™ bridge provides sustain, resonance, and perfect intonation.
            
            With classic Fender style, advanced features and stunning new finishes, the Player Plus Meteora Bass is the perfect tool to spark your creativity and stand out from the crowd.
