        <h1>SteveHarris<span>Bass</span></h1>
        <p> Steve Harris's galloping fleet-fingered basslines have turbocharged U.K. metal titans Iron Maiden for decades and have made him the most influential metal bassist alive. Harris has stayed true to his battle-hardened Precision Bass over the years, and his signature Steve Harris Precision Bass now comes in his famously regal gloss White finish with special pinstriping, mirrored pickguard and West Ham United F.C. crest. Other ironclad features include a single powerful Seymour Duncan® Steve Harris signature model pickup, Fender HiMass™ bridge, Fender round-wound strings and Harris's signature on the back of the headstock.
             A set of Rotosound® Steve Harris Signature flat-wound strings are included.
