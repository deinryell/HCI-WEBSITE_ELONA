        <h1>Fender<span>JazzBass</span></h1>
        <p> American Ultra is our most advanced series of guitars and basses for discerning players who demand the ultimate in precision, performance and tone. The American Ultra Jazz Bass features a unique “Modern D” neck profile for hours of playing comfort, and the tapered neck heel allows easy access to the highest register. A speedy 10”-14” compound-radius fingerboard with 21 medium-jumbo frets means effortless action, while the Ultra Noiseless™ Vintage pickups and redesigned preamp provide endless tonal possibilities – without hum. The sculpted rear body contours are as beautiful as they are functional. 
            This versatile, state-of-the-art instrument will inspire you to push your playing to new heights.
            The Jazz Bass featured dual single-coil pickups with two polepieces per string, giving it a brighter, more trebly tone with healthy midrange growl. Some bass players 
            believe that having the ability to adjust each Jazz Bass through two volume knobs and a master tone circuitpickup gave them more sound variations.
