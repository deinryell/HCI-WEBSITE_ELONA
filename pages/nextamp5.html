        <p>You should definitely love this instrument if you're after biting and slightly dark sound because that's what this guitar really is really famous for. Thanks to its shorter scale, Fender Jaguar is also commonly preferred by guitarists with smaller hands or beginner players who benefit from its convenient playability.
            The Fender Jaguar's sound, rich in harmonic overtones, is often attributed to these relatively long strings behind the bridge.
